On President Aquino's state visit to Canada on May 2015, the president disclosed that he had met with Poe prior to the trip, although he didn't say on what the meeting was for. A couple of days later, Poe confirmed that she did meet with Aquino. Poe said that "We discussed his intention to choose a candidate who, first and foremost, has the trust of the nation, and, secondly, has the potential to win in the election, in order to sustain the reforms especially against corruption and the pro-poor programs of the government." Poe expects more meetings with Aquino in June. <span style="color:red;">Read more...</span>

In May 2015, Binay remarked that he would run for president because the country has to have leaders with "experience and competence", insinuating Grace Poe's relative inexperience in politics. Poe replied aside from experience and competence, the country's leaders have to be honest, this time insinuating Binay's corruption cases while he was mayor of Makati. A day later, Binay suggested that Poe should be his running mate, which was rebuffed by Poe, saying that she doesn't see it happening right now, emphasizing that honesty and scrutiny is important, and that they differ on those aspects. Binay, in a 24 Oras interview, said that he respected Poe turning down his offer, and clarified that his statement on experience and competence did not refer to anyone in particular.<span style="color:red;">Read more...</span>

Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte reportedly enjoys the support of several netizens who laud his performance, especially on maintaining peace and order but he was quick to shrug off calls for him to run as President on February 2014, saying he is not qualified for higher public office. A year later, Duterte said on a Baguio federalism forum that he'll only run for president "if only to save the republic." Duterte cited the need of about 10 to 15 billion pesos as a campaign war chest that's keeping him from running. Days later, Duterte "re-entered" PDP-Laban; he maintained he never left the party, but had to stand in a local party banner in the 2013 local election to ensure victory. PDP-Laban president Aquilino Pimentel III later said that Duterte is among his party's options in nominating for the presidency, noting that the party's position on federalism coincides with Duterte's advocacy.<span style="color:red;">Read more...</span>

In a March 2013 interview on Mornings @ ANC, Alan Peter Cayetano said "I want to be president of this country. I think I can do something great for God and his people."[28] By March 2014, he formed a team to prepare for the campaign. By October 2014, Cayetano said "With the present ratings, who would run?” after a Pulse Asia poll suggests that he is doing poorly. Cayetano clarified though that is not withdrawing from the race.
A month later, Cayetano said that he is not in a rush to make a decision for the 2016 election, after fellow Nacionalista Senator Trillanes revealed that Cayetano was being considered by their party to run; Cayetano pointed out that it seems that it is Binay who is in a hurry to become president. On March 2015, Cayetano said that "If I do run, I'll run for President and not for Vice President," removing him from the vice presidential candidate discussion.
On September 16, Cayetano told reporters that he is giving up his plans to run for the presidency in 2016, but hasn't closed his doors for a vice presidential campaign, preferring either to be the running mate of Mar Roxas or Rodrigo Duterte.
Senator Alan Peter Cayetano, announced that he will seek candidacy for running as Vice President. Cayetano, who he is the member of Nacionalista Party, did not mention his Presidential running-mate as NP will meet in a few days, for their decision.<span style="color:red;">Read more...</span>

Asked in a November 2012 interview on radio DZBB if he is going to run for president, Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. said he is not closing his doors and “There’s a saying, ‘Never say never,’ so maybe.”[56] By June 2013, Nacionalista Party president Manny Villar advised his party-mates who were openly talking about their plans for the 2016 election not to talk about it as it was too early.
His mother, Ilocos Norte Representative and former First Lady Imelda Marcos revealed he wants him to run so he can follow the footsteps and continue the legacy of his father, former President Ferdinand Marcos. She also added that he is fit for the position because "He has an impressive track record and a good vision for the country."
In another radio interview, this time at DZMM AM on March 2015, Marcos said that "we will thoroughly study everything," when asked about people clamoring for him to run. He added that the "default setting" for him in 2016 is to defend his Senate seat. This means that he will surely participate in the 2016 elections, but unclear on what position.<span style="color:red;">Read more...</span>

Escudero's involvement in politics started in the 1980s as an organizer for the local campaign of his father. He first expressed interest in running for public office as municipal councilor of Sorsogon when he was 22. At 25, he again indicated his intention run, this time as mayor of the municipality. However, on both occasions, his family forbade him from entering politics and insisted that he finish his law studies before embarking on a political career.
Escudero was 28 when he began his political career. He ran and won as representatives of the first district of Sorsogon in 1998. He is one of the youngest lawmakers in the 11th Congress.
Escudero was a member of the Nationalist People's Coalition, the second biggest political party in the Philippines, from 1998 to 2009.<span style="color:red;">Read more...</span>

Interior and Local Government Secretary Mar Roxas acknowledged that Panfilo Lacson is qualified to run in for president, but there have been no talks on the latter joining the Liberal Party. Despite of this, he said on February 2014 that he is “color blind” to politics and would rather focus on rehabilitating areas hit by Typhoon Yolanda.
After resigning as presidential assistant for recovery in February 2015, Lacson, in a press conference at the Diamond Hotel in Manila, told reporters that he is "not planning, but contemplating" about running for the presidency. Aside from another presidential campaign, Lacson is considering a return to the Senate, while ruling out local politics. On April 2015, Lacson confirmed that he has the intention in running for president, although his final decision would depend on many factors, which he didn't elaborate. On a press conference at Baguio a couple of weeks later, Lacson announced his intention to be an independent candidate for president. A month later, Lacson said that he will announce his decision to run for president after the next survey is released.<span style="color:red;">Read more...</span>

In a press conference on July 2, 2014, Miriam Defensor Santiago revealed she is suffering from Stage 4 lung cancer and she might run as president for the third time if it goes into remission.
By November 2014, Santiago, in a tweet, announced that "In the 2016 presidential elections, when I am rid of my lung cancer, I intend to claim the presidency I won in 1992." In a letter to the Senate, Santiago said that more than 90% of the cancer cells have regressed. Early in 2015, Santiago said "I expect to be able to run for president if I get well, simply because it's boring, boring, boring. The landscape is boring."<span style="color:red;">Read more...</span>

Afters being jailed at the Philippine National Police custodial center in Quezon City due to the PDAF scam, Revilla on May 2015 said that he is still open to running in 2016, as no law prohibits incarcerated people from running.

As for what position, I will abide by the Nacionalista Party."
Almost a year later, Trillanes announced his preference to run as vice president in a weekly forum at the Senate. As with his May 2014 statement, he says that he will submit to the decision of the Nacionalistas, which would meet sometime before the end of April 2015. Amongst the Nacionalista Party's options are fielding its own standard bearer, form a coalition with the Liberals, or adopt an independent candidate.
By August 2015, Trillanes bared his plans of running as an independent vice presidential candidate, saying that the Nacionalistas would not endorse a candidate if more than one of them ran for the vice presidency.
